In the paper, returns to net worth are constructed as 
$$ r_t = \frac{y_{t}^{c} + cg_t + y_{t}^{d}}{A_{t-1} + .5F_t}. $$

What lines of the PSID codebook are the variables $y_{t}^{c}$ (payments on debt) and $F_t$ (net investment flows) referring to?

The rest of the variables referenced in sections 2.1 and 2.2 can be quickly mapped from the paper to the codebook.
