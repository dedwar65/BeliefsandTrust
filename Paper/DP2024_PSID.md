In the paper, returns to net worth are constructed as $$r_t = \frac{y_{t}^{c} + cg_t + y_{t}^{d}}{A_{t-1} + .5F_t}$$.

What lines of the PSID codebook are the variables $y_{t}^{c}$ (payments on debt) and $F_t$ (net investment flows) referring to?

For example, in the 2019 survey, there is a variable ER72053 "A25 MNTHLY PMTS MOR 1" with associated question "A25. How much are your monthly loan payments?--FIRST MORTGAGE". This was the closest reference to a payment on debt that I could find, and it is only for a single asset class. The same issue is true for net investment flows. 

Again, the core issue is that the rest of the variables referenced in sections 2.1 and 2.2 can be quickly mapped from the paper to the codebook. There is either a footnote in the paper or the name of the variable in the paper is close enough to the name in the codebook.
